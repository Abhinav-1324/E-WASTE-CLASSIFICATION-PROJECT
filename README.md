# â™» E-Waste Image Classification Project

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project is a deep learning-based image classifier that identifies *10 types of electronic waste* such as Mobile Phones, PCBs, Printers, and more. It uses *EfficientNetV2B0* with transfer learning to achieve high accuracy on a custom image dataset.

Built and deployed using *TensorFlow, **Gradio, and **Google Colab*.
